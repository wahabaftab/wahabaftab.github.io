This site is hosted at Github Pages, powered by Jekyll's So Simple Theme. It's my personal site to showcase my projects and blogs. You can visit it at the following link: https://www.wahabaftab.com/

## Notable Changes
I have made some changes from the repo I forked some of them are:
* About me page was created
* Another replica of post folder was added which is not a collection, that folder is _certifications and is made to seperate project posts and certificate posts even tho layout of both pages is same
* Blogs were added and modified such that they have external urls to medium site to view blogs.
* Favicon image was added.
* _Layout folder was added to edit previous layouts and add some new ones.
* _includes folder was added to change theme default html files. One major change was that title is now not hidden if there is a image in the page layout.
* Resume was added as a page
