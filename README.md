## General description

This site is set up to serve as a blogging space and research space for Frey Brownson, of Heliotactic Press. So Simple Theme

Looking for a simple, responsive, theme for your Jekyll powered blog? Well look no further. Here be **So Simple Theme**, the followup to [**Minimal Mistakes**](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) -- by designer slash illustrator [Michael Rose](http://mademistakes.com).

## Notable Changes
I have made some changes from the repo I forked some of them are:
* About me page was created
* Another replica of post folder was added without collections i.e certifications which are shown in the certification page
* Blogs were added and modified such that they have external urls to medium site to view blogs.
* Favicon image was added.
* _Layout folder was added to edit previous layouts and add some new ones.
* _includes folder was added to change theme default html files. One major change was that title is now not hidden if there is a image in the page layout.
* Resume was added as a page

## Getting Started

So Simple takes advantage of Sass and data files to make customizing easier. These features require Jekyll 2.x and will not work with older versions of Jekyll.

To learn how to install and use this theme check out the [Setup Guide](http://mmistakes.github.io/so-simple-theme/theme-setup/) for more information.
